# finalyearproject
This repository contains my final year project for 4th year of college. It is developed in Android and it is a social media project.
It aims to allow a user to search for local astro pitches near them by setting the distance parameter eg give me the nearest astro pitches
5km. The users will be able to advertise for players to play an astro game if they need an extra player. They will be able to message other
users of the app. They will be able to set up a username and profile picture. It will be developed in Android studio using Java and will use
Firebase database for backend storage, setting up user login accounts and user uploads eg profile pictures. At the moment the project is not
fully complete. The functionality that has been completed is user login, user account and file upload and google maps implemented to allow
the user to search for astro pitches around their location.
